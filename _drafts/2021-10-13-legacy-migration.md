Been a while since I last updated this. I was busy trying to get myself certified as a AWS Solutions Architect Professional.

Recently, my team has successfully released our application to replace a legacy system. This migration effort had two main areas of work:
1. Re-design and develop a new system to fill the same market (but with tons of new features, and a fundamental shift in the data model)   
2. Migrate data from the legacy system to the new system

The topic of this post focuses on 2.
