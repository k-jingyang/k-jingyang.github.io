After being part of a Scrum team for more than a year, I realised that I have not thought deeply enough about Agile. 

Having attended Agile and ScrumMaster courses, my mind operated in the fashion of "Agile is this..., not this..." and "Scrum is this.., not this...", without understanding the why. So, I decided to put some thought to understand and reason about Agile from first principles, hoping to have a better understanding of it.

This post was written specifically in the context of software development as I am not familiar with the application and usage of Agile in other fields. But I hope that these insights are transferrable!

### The first principle
**Ultimately, software engineering is all about delivering value.** You could be part of a product team, working on a software product that satisfy the needs of your company or a client. You could even be part of a developer productivity team, working on tools to improve how your product team colleagues work. You are delivering value.

Naturally, the next question to ask ourselves is, what does it mean to deliver value? I think that it boils down to these three:
- Being able to identify a problem to solve
- Using the right solution to solve the problem
- Getting better at solving problems

### Identifying the problem & using the right solution

Fundamentally, how does being able to identify problems and solving them deliver value? 

By solving problems, you increase the amount of available resources either by freeing up existing resources or by increasing the total pool of resources. For example, you built a feature that allows your user to complete a task in a fraction of the time he/she usually takes. You just freed up his/her time (a resource).

The understanding of the problem greatly affects the solution. We need to correctly identify the problem before coming up with any solution. 

Then, why is it important to use the right solution? 
1. It needs to be able to solve the problem
1. Because a solution has its costs. We have to ensure that its benefits outweigh its up-front and future costs. 

### Getting better at solving the right problems
