After being part of a Scrum team for more than a year, I realised that I have not thought deeply enough about Agile. 

Having attended Agile and ScrumMaster courses, my mind operated in the fashion of "Agile is this..., not this..." and "Scrum is this.., not this...", without understanding the why. So, I decided to put some thought to understand and reason about Agile from first principles, hoping to have a better understanding of it.

This post was written specifically in the context of software development as I am not familiar with the application and usage of Agile in other fields. But I do hope that these insights are transferrable!

### The first principle
*Ultimately, software engineering is all about delivering value.* You could be part of a product team, working on a software product that satisfies the needs of your company or a client. You could even be part of a developer productivity team, working on tools to improve how your product team colleagues work. You are delivering value.

Naturally, the next question to ask ourselves is, what does it mean to deliver value? I think that it boils down to these three point:
1. Being able to correctly identify a problem to solve
1. Using the right solution to solve the problem
1. Getting better at solving problems

### Why the emphasis on solving problems?
All three points are essentially about solving problems. Why is that so? Fundamentally, how does being able to identify problems and solving them deliver value? 

By solving the right problems, you increase the amount of available resources either by freeing up existing resources or by increasing the total pool of resources. For example, you built a feature that allows your user to complete a task in a fraction of the time he/she usually takes. You just freed up his/her time (a resource).

### Correctly identifying the problem
Our understanding of a problem greatly affects what our solutions. To avoid barking up the wrong tree, we need to correctly identify the problem before coming up with any solutions. **Imagine having spent months working on a solution to find out that the problem you have previously identified was wrong.** What a waste of resources.

### Using the right solution
Then, why is it important to use the right solution? 

1. Obviously it needs to be able to solve the problem. 
2. Because every solution has its associated costs. We have to ensure that its benefits outweigh its up-front and future costs.

**Imagine having spent months working on a solution to find out that the solution you came up with does not actually solve the problem or it is too expensive to maintain.** Again, a waste of resources.

### Getting better at solving the problems
Getting better at solving the right problems is delivering value in the second order. If you are this good at solving problems and delivering value now, imagine how it will be when you improve and get better at it.

### Beating up waterfall model again
The waterfall model where we capture all our requirements into a specification document and implement them only after doing so, does not allow us to:
1. Correctly identify the problem to solve
1. Validate that our solution is right

You have to get them (the problem and the solution) right in one try, the time when you specified them in the document. Because of that, it is exceptionally bad at dealing with the **two bolded scenarios** I have highlighted above. This creates a huge amount of risk because you would have wasted a huge amount of resource if such scenarios were to happen.    

The reality is that you most probably will not get them right on your first try. Agile accepts this reality. 

### Agile, finally


The [Agile manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) states that

> **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
>
> **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
>
> **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
>
> **Responding to change** over following a plan


**Individuals and interactions**
