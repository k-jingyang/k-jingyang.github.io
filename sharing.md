Occasionally, I try my best to talk and share about topics that I learnt. Here are some of them.

### Accelerate

I shared about the metrics that software teams can measure themselves against, and practices they can adopt.

Based of materials from _Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps: Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations_

### Data Migration

Based on my work and experience on migrating the data from a legacy system to a new system, I covered insights, good practices and painful lessons learnt.

### TLS

Always had trouble with understanding the various components of TLS, thought it'll help others who are in the same situation.

In this sharing, I give a brief overview of TLS, HTTP and smainly cover the TLS handshake, digital signatures, and certificates. 

Largely based of {% post_url 2020-12-12-tls %}
