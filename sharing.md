Occasionally, I try my best to talk and share about topics that I learnt. Here are some of them.

### Accelerate

I shared about the metrics that software teams can measure themselves against, and practices they can adopt.

Based of materials from _Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps: Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations_

### Data Migration

Based on my work and experience on migrating the data from a legacy system to a new system, I covered insights, good practices and painful lessons learnt.
