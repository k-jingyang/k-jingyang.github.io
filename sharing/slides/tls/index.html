					## Understanding TLS
					High level introduction to Transport Layer Security 
					
					(and sorta HTTPS)
					---
					## Takeaways
					- What is HTTPS 
					- Mental model of how the various parts of TLS fit together <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
						- Easily work on TLS configuration tasks or resolve any cert issues 
					- "If our private CA decides to use a new root cert, what do we need to do?" <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
					---
					## Overview
					- Super brief intro to TLS, HTTPS
					- Asymmetric & Symmetric Encryption
					- TLS Connection & Handshake
					- Digital Signatures
					- Certificates
					---
					## TLS, HTTPS 
					- Transport Layer Security (Latest version: 1.3)
					- Provides a way to encrypt your communication <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
						- HTTPS = Using TLS to encrypt your HTTP messages
					- What's SSL? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
						- TLS supersedes SSL
						- Terms often used interchangeably
					---
					## Symmetric & Asymmetric Encryption
					---
					### Symmetric Encryption
					- The same key is used to encrypt and decrypt
						- Both parties need to have the same key
					- E.g.
						- AES
						- DES
					---
					### Asymmetric Encryption (Public-key cryptography)
					- A pair of keys (public key, private key)
						- Use public key to encrypt and private key to decrypt
					- Can you do it the other way around? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
						- Yes
							- RSA algorithm (keys can be interchanged, but different security properties)
						- No
							- Most other algorithms (keys are not interchangeable, e.g. Diffie-Hellman)
					---
					## What is a TLS connection?
					- Data transferred is encrypted using a symmetric key
						- For HTTPS, data = HTTP messages
					- Both parties needs to arrive at the same symmetric key, how?	<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
						- TLS handshake (asymmetric encryption happens here; certs, digital signature, public key, private key)

					## TLS v1.2 Handshake
					- Why 1.2 instead of 1.3? 
						- More intuitive to understand the purpose of the various components from 1.2's handshake

					Based on the handshake, we'll go more in depth on
					1. Digital signature
					1. Certificates

					---
					### Digital signature
					"Client verifies the digital signature of the message signed by the server's private key"
					
					---
					## What is a digital signature?
					- fn(sent_message_hash, private_key) such that we can verify it against fn(received_message_hash, public_key)  
					- What does it guarantee? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
						- Origin - Validates that it's signed by the private key, and because nobody else should own the private key
						- Integrity - Validates the message hash, so what's received = what's sent

					- Server random
					- **Certificate** (this contains the public key of the server)
					- **Digital signature** of this message signed by the server's private key
					
					</div>
					</div>
					</div>
					---
					## Certificates
					"Client verifies the certificate (given by the server) against its CA certs store (which contains recognized CA certificates)"
					- There are actually 2 types of certs here <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
						- Cert given by the server (i.e. the server cert, contains the public key of the server)
						- Certs in the CA certs store (i.e. the root certs store, contains the public keys of the root CAs)
					---
					## Verifying the server certificate
					- The server cert must be issued by a CA whose cert is in the root CA certs store*
					- The principle here is that the CA has done its checks to ensure that the entity owning the server is legitimate before issuing the cert <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

					---
					## How to verify that a cert was issued by the CA?
					- Apply what we learnt about signing!
					- The server cert has a digital signature and was signed by the CA using their private key, and we have the public key of the CA in our CA certs store! <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
						- *fn(sent_message_hash, private_key) such that we can verify it against fn(received_message_hash, public_key)*
					---
					## Examples
					---
					<img src="https://docs.min.io/minio/baremetal/_images/console-dashboard1.png"  height="50%" width="50%">

					Using your web browser to access MinIO's console page via HTTPS

					- MinIO needs to have a server cert
					- Web browser needs to have the cert of the CA that issued MinIO's server cert, in its cert store

					---
					Our Java app accessing MinIO's API via HTTPS

					- MinIO needs to have a server cert
					- Our Java app needs to have the cert of the CA that issued MinIO's server cert, in its cert store
						- `JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts`

					---

					```bash
					curl: (60) SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate
					More details here: https://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html
					```

					or similar problems, what is it about?

					When we `curl --insecure` or similar things (e.g. `sslVerify=false`), what are we essentially doing? 
					<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

					---
					## Self-signed certs (w/o a CA)
					- Use `openssl` to generate for your servers
					- Won't be recognised by clients unless installed in clients' certs store

					---
					## How to be issued a certificate from the CA?
					- Create a cert signing request (CSR), which contains your public key and sends it to a CA

					---
					
					## Aren't you simplifying?
					Yes, I am

					---
					
					## Intermediate CAs & Certificates
					- *The server cert must be issued by a CA whose cert is in the root CA certs store*
						- Not necessarily <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

					---

					## Intermediate CAs & Certificates
					- The root CA whose cert is in the root certs stores can grant someone else, an Intermediate CA the ability to issue certs 
						- (who can then grant someone else)
						- such that the issued cert can verified with the root CA's cert 
						<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
						- Certificate chain 
						<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

					---

					## Certificate chain
					- Root CA -> Server cert
						- Verify server cert against root CA's cert in the root certs store
					- Root CA -> Intermediate CA -> Server cert  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
						- Verify server cert against intermediate CA's cert 
						- Verify intermediate CA's cert against root CA's cert in the root certs store  
					- Root CA -> Intermediate CA1 -> Intermediate CA2 -> Server cert? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

					## Summary

					- How TLS encrypts HTTP to form HTTPS
						- Symmetric key encryption
						- TLS handshake
					- Digital signatures
						- How it works
					- Certificates
						- Server cert & CA certs
						- Examples & common issues
						- Intermediate CAs & certs

					---
					"If our private CA decides to use a new root cert (based on a new key pair), what do we need to do?"

					---
					- Have we included the new CA cert in the necessary cert stores?
						- Web browser
						- Java cert store

					- Do we need to get new server certs?
						- Is the old CA cert going to expire or revoked from the root certs stores?
