				## KM Data Migration
				Collection of insights, tips, painful lessons from the data migration
				---
				### Disclaimer
				- Hindsight is always 20/20
				- These are data points from a single event
				---
				## Let's start!
				---
 				## Repeat, repeat, repeat
				- Keep repeating your migrations 
					- Shortens your feedback loop <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
						- You want to know ASAP whether your changes are working (sounds familiar?)
				- Automate <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
					- Cronjobs
					- Scheduled stored procedures
				---
				### The Checklist Manifesto
				- Have a checklist of the things to do for the day of the migration  <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 
				- Rehearse <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
					- Be careful of fatigue (i.e. skipping steps because you think you know it)
				- Have a tickbox where you have to really tick it <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
				- Automate <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
					- Shell scripts
				---
				## Technical debt 
				- If it lasts months, debt collectors will come knocking 
					- Changes will come
				- It's worth investing some effort to pay it down or to avoid taking on any <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
				---
				## Technical debt (cont.)
				- What could have been done/done more of 
					- SQL linting <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
					- Comments <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
						- Technical constraint that should have been fixed much earlier  
					- Tests <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
				- The earlier you build these in, the better <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
				---
				
				Technical debt & bus factor create a vicious cycle
				---
				## Data, oh you so nasty 
				- Always validate your assumptions about the data
					- DB constraints saved me many many times
				
				---
				## Getting users to clean up
				- Give them data in the form that is usable for them to clean up 
				- What's a reasonable default behaviour if the data is not cleaned up? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
				- Development effort vs User effort <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

				```python 
				if trivial:
					dev()
				elif user_effort is reasonable:
					user_cleanup()
				else:
					dev()
				``` 
				<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
				---
				## Sanity checks
				- Never underestimate this
				- Saved by this even though we didn't do enough
				- Ideally, the migration logic and sanity checks should be implemented by different people <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
				---
				## Dear migrated data, 
				## where were you from?
				- Always have data lineage <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
					- Identify where a piece of migrated data was from (i.e. a unique id in the previous system)
				- Makes patching easier! <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
				---
				## Git is our friend
				- Always check in your
					- Migration scripts
					- Scripts that generate user clean up lists
					- Reference data lists 
				---
				"Are you testing migration now? Let me know once you're done so I can test mine" x 1000..
				---
				## De-coupling teams
				- Data coupling 
					- KM -> T3
					- KM flushes data to test -> T3 cannot test <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
					- T3 needs data -> KM cannot test  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
				- De-coupling teams <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
					- Two working sets of data
