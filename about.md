Hi there, I'm Jing Yang. I'm passionate about solving problems and implementing ideas using technology. 

Graduated in 2018 from Nanyang Technological University with a Bachelor in Computer Science. Having dabbled in cyber security and robotics, I'm currently enjoying working as a Backend Software Engineer.

As detailed [here]({% post_url 2020-10-06-raison-detre %}), I'm using this blog to work on myself. 

If there's anything that I've written in this blog that is factually incorrect, do let me know via [email](mailto:{{ site.email }}).
