Hi there, I'm Jing Yang. I'm passionate about solving problems and implementing ideas using technology. 

Graduated in 2018 from Nanyang Technological University with a Bachelor in Computer Science. Having dabbled in cyber security and robotics, I'm currently enjoying working as a Backend Software Engineer.
