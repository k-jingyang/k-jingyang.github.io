Using this blog, I want to:
1. Improve my writing
1. Record my learnings and small wins
1. Solidify my understanding and identify any knowledge gaps by writing about what I learnt

In a way, this blog is a form of an engineering logbook; To provide a platform to pen down thoughts, and to facilitate my growth.

Guiding principles:
1. A post does not have to be perfect
1. The blog does not have to be astonishingly pretty
1. Learnings may not have to be software engineering related
